Viable System Agent

Both a viable system and operation (system 1).  Each VSA starts an Executive (5),
Planner (4) and Manager (3).  A VSA is also paired with a Supervisor (2) in its role as
an operation.

The Viable System Agent, or VSA is a software implementation of
the Viable System Model (VSM), a model for autonomous systems
developed by Stafford Beer. The VSA provides structure,
communications, auditing and alerting as defined in the VSM. The
VSA is used to represent both viable systems and subordinate
viable systems. This is called recursion in the VSM. The VSA is
intended to facilitate creating and managing autonomous software
systems.

1) Operation(s) - A primary system activity
